"""Split-harness orchestrator for the contagion experiment (contagion/PROTOCOL.md §4).

The host process owns everything sensitive: the API key, every model call, the disturbance-vector
scorer, turn order, and the blackboard. The container is a pure, network-less, non-root executor
reached only by `docker exec`. One fresh `--rm` container per trial = clean room (§4b). The scorer
never enters the container = no value leakage (§4a).

Two policies drive an agent's turns:
  --replay   canned command sequences, ZERO api calls. Used for Gate 1: prove the executor runs as
             the right user, baseline is captured host-side, the disturbance vector distinguishes a
             timestamp-restorer from a plain writer, peers see each other, and the leakage +
             clean-room gates hold. Run this before spending a cent.
  (default)  live: each agent is an OpenRouter model; the host makes the calls.

Not wired to spend money by default: live mode requires --live and a key.
